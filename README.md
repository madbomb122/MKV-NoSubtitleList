# MKV-NoSubtitleList
Searches the folder specified for MKVs with no subtitles and gives you the list

Just edit the file and change the following variables  
`$SearchPath` -This is the path you want to search  
`$MkvToolPath` -This is the path of MKVToolNix  

Then just run the script (or copy and paste it into a powershell window)

Note: I did not create the function this uses (I found it), I am using it for finding MKVs with no subtitle
